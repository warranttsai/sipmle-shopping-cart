A simple shopping cart interface allows users to select, reserve, and purchase products from an eCommerce platform. It presents product information such as name, price, monthly sale, and rate. Users can add products to the cart by clicking on the plus button and remove them by clicking on the minus button. The price is calculated and displayed at the bottom left of the interface. The shopping cart software is an essential part of the online shopping experience, enabling customers to review, modify, and finalize their selected items before making a purchase.

The interface also provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users to manage their potential purchases. It allows customers to update their items easily, remove unwanted items, and make changes to the quantity, size, or color of the products. Additionally, the software calculates the purchase total, tax, discounts, and shipping, and facilitates the payment process, notifying the retailer and the payment processor of the orders and transactions.

In summary, a simple shopping cart interface is a fundamental component of an eCommerce platform, providing users with the flexibility and control to manage their selected items and complete their purchases efficiently.
